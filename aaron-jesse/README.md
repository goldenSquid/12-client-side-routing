# Lab 12 Sample Starter Code

Use this code as needed when working on Lab 12. 

If you have previous code from Lab 11 that you prefer then feel free to stick with that. But this code base will be used for in class review going forward.

This starter code covers what we went over in class with the addition of markup and styling.

NOTE: The dotenv package is not used in this code, so add that on your own if you like.
